# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Analysis of the Kaggle Titanic dataset, focusing on ticket classifications and their correlation with survival rates using data cleaning and visualization techniques.


## Description ##
This project involved analyzing the Kaggle Titanic dataset to uncover patterns between passenger ticket information and survival rates. The "Ticket" column, which contains both numeric and alphanumeric values, was meticulously processed to identify trends and insights. Numeric tickets were categorized into predefined ranges, and survival probabilities were assigned to each category, while alphanumeric tickets were preserved for separate exploration.

Key tasks included data cleaning to handle mixed data types, feature engineering to create meaningful ticket-based categories, and visualization to highlight survival trends across different ticket groups. The analysis revealed correlations between specific ticket patterns and passenger survival rates, shedding light on socio-economic or logistical factors that may have influenced outcomes during the disaster.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, making it a valuable addition to a portfolio in data science and machine learning.


Features:
- Data Cleaning: Handled mixed data types (numeric and alphanumeric) in the "Ticket" column to ensure accurate analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Created categorized ticket ranges and assigned survival probabilities based on predefined thresholds.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized survival trends based on ticket classifications to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Custom Logic Implementation: Developed logic to handle both numeric and alphanumeric tickets without losing key information.
- Correlation Analysis: Identified relationships between ticket types/ranges and survival rates.
  
Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle Datasets
- Jupyter Notebook/VS Code
